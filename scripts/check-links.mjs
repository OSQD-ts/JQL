// Adapted from bothandlerjs.
// Every internal link in the documentation, checked.
//
// The README used to be one file, where a wrong anchor was visible the moment you
// scrolled. Split across `docs/`, a link can point at a heading that moved, or a file
// that was renamed, and read perfectly right in the diff. This is cheap enough to run
// on every push, so nothing has to be remembered.
//
// Only local links are followed. Checking that the internet still hosts what it
// hosted yesterday is a different job, and one that fails builds for reasons that
// have nothing to do with the change under test.

 * Every markdown file in the repository, found rather than listed.

 * It used to be a hand-written list, which has the failure mode you would expect: a
 * page added to `docs/` was not checked, and a page *renamed* was reported as "listed
 * for checking but does not exist" — a true statement about the list rather than about
 * the documentation. Walking the tree means a new page is covered the moment it is
 * written, which is the only way this stays true of a directory that has thirty of them.
